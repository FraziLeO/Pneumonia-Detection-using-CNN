**Problem Statement**

The problem addressed in this report is the need for an accurate and efficient method of diagnosing pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Despite advancements in medical imaging technology, pneumonia diagnosis remains challenging due to the variability in imaging patterns and the subjective nature of interpretation. This project aims to develop a robust solution utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automate the diagnosis process, thereby reducing the reliance on manual interpretation and improving diagnosti accuracy. By leveraging a curated dataset of chest X-ray images from pediatric patients, the report seeks to evaluate the performance of the CNN model in accurately identifying pneumonia cases and distinguishing them from normal cases. Through this endeavor, the ultimate objective is to provide healthcare professionals with a reliable tool for early and accurate pneumonia diagnosis, leading to timely intervention and improved patient outcomes.
